This is an WIP project for playing around in react and building a landing space for a future NHL analytics project

TODO:

- UI
  - waiting to build out more components before organizing
- Standings:
  - more table info or separate widget for standings sidebar and page?
  - sorting?
  - division/conference/wildcard views
- Team view
  - start with roster info from api
- Player view
  - database or direct api access?
